AC Machine Simulation in C (Tutorial Version)

I have used C to simulate motor control and adptive observers for 4 years now. 
This is a tutorial for those who hate using Simulink to simulate motor control.

The numerical integration method is currently RK4, which is quite enough. DoPri54 will be included in future revision.

If you speak Chinese, I have a dedicated tutorial video about how to make this thing work from the ground up.
